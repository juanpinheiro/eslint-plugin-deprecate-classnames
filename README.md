This plugin helps you refactor your codebase by identifying and replacing deprecated CSS class names.

## Installation

First, you'll need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```sh
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install eslint-plugin-deprecate-classnames:

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-deprecate-classnames --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add `deprecate-classnames` to the `plugins` section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "deprecate-classnames"
  ]
}
```

Then configure the rules you want to use under the `rules` section.

## Rules

### `classnames`

This rule identifies the use of deprecated class names in your JSX/TSX files and suggests alternatives.

#### Example:

##### Specific classnames:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classnames": [
      "error",
      { "name": "test-classname", "use": "new-classname" }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Multiple classnames:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classnames": [
      "error",
      {
        "names": ["test-classname", "test-classname-2"],
        "use": "new-classname"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Regular expression for classnames:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classnames": [
      "error",
      { "nameRegExp": "^test-", "use": "new-classname" }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Multiple rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classnames": [
      "error",
      { "name": "old-classname1", "use": "new-classname1" },
      { "name": "old-classname2", "use": "new-classname2" },
      { "nameRegExp": "^deprecated-", "use": "new-class" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### `classes`

This rule identifies the use of deprecated class names within the [classes prop used in Material-UI components](https://v4.mui.com/customization/components/#overriding-styles-with-classes) and suggests alternatives.

#### Example:

##### Specific classnames:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classes": [
      "error",
      { "name": "test-classname", "use": "new-classname" }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Multiple classnames:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classes": [
      "error",
      {
        "names": ["test-classname", "test-classname-2"],
        "use": "new-classname"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Regular expression for classnames:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classes": [
      "error",
      { "nameRegExp": "^test-", "use": "new-classname" }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Multiple rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "deprecate-classnames/classes": [
      "error",
      { "name": "old-classname1", "use": "new-classname1" },
      { "name": "old-classname2", "use": "new-classname2" },
      { "nameRegExp": "^deprecated-", "use": "new-class" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Credits

This plugin is an extension of the [eslint-plugin-deprecate](https://github.com/AlexMost/eslint-plugin-deprecate) by AlexMost. The original plugin provides a flexible way to deprecate functions and variables, and this extension builds on that foundation to specifically target and manage deprecated class names in JSX and TSX files, with a special focus on the `classes` prop used in Material-UI components.
